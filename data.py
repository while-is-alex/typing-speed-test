    'Finding truth is difficult, and the road to it is rough. As seekers of the truth, you will be wise to withhold '
    'judgement. And not simply put your trust in the writings of the ancients. You must question and critically '
    'examine\nthose writings from every side. You must admit only to argument and experiment,\nand not to the sayings '
    'of any person. For every human being is vulnerable to all kinds of imperfection. As seekers of the truth, we must '
    'also suspect. And question our own ideas as we perform our investigations. To avoid falling into prejudice or '
    'careless thinking. Take this course and truth will be revealed to you.',
