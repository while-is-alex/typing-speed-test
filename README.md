# Typing speed test
This application allows you to find out how many words you are able to type in a minute, as well as how accurate you can be when it comes to spelling and, finally, your overall speed (your words per minute versus your accuracy).

## Getting started
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/while-is-alex/typing-speed-test.git
```

2. Change the directory to the project folder.

3. Create a virtual environment:
```
py -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/activate
```

4. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Finally, to get started with the test, run the `main.py` file. The app will launch and diplsay the home screen.
